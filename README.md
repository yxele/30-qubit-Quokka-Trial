# 30-qubit-Quokka-Trial
This project is a hands-on evaluation of the Quokka Puck as an educational quantum-computing device, documenting my journey from implementing a simple Bell-state entanglement circuit to scaling Deutsch–Jozsa and attempting Grover’s algorithm across three programming routes: Qiskit (local simulation), OpenQASM (run via Quokka), and Quokka’s native operation syntax. Along the way I recorded runtime scaling, debugging lessons (measurement encodings, bit-ordering, API/response-format pitfalls), and the practical meaning of “~30 qubits” in real workloads—showing how algorithm structure and multi-controlled gate decompositions (especially in Grover) dominate performance and cause failures long before the headline qubit count. The repo includes reproducible notebooks, experimental results, and an evaluative write-up aimed at helping learners understand not just the algorithms, but the realities of running them on a constrained educational quantum emulator.
